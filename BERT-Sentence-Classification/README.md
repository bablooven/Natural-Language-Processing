# BERT Fine-Tuning Tutorial with PyTorch
-Adopted from the tutorial by Chris McCormick and Nick Ryan

In this tutorial, we will use BERT with the huggingface PyTorch library to quickly and efficiently fine-tune a model to get near state of the art performance in sentence classification. More broadly, a practical application of transfer learning in NLP to create high performance models with minimal effort on a range of NLP tasks will be outlined.
